**Original Proposal:**

For my website, I am planning on creating a portfolio for the written, digital, and physical works I have created. I want things to open with a minimalistic yet intriguing page that piques viewers' curiosity and gives them the opportunity to explore. My plan for this page is very roughly shown in my sketch. There will be 3 main sections that display my work; one for writing, one for digital, and one for physical. The writing page will have my academic research, journalism, and creative pieces. The digital page will likely show graphic design, audio, photo, and video works. The physical page will show my paintings and collage work. My assets will include all of the things I just listed as well as a picture of myself for the about/contact page.

**Reflection on First Submission:**

My website functions as a portfolio to share my digital designs and written work. I think my site is relatively similar to the outline I originally drew in class, although some things were modified to fit the timeframe and my skill level. Learning html and css was certainly the most daunting project of this semester and definitely challenged me. Once I figured out the basics, I had a lot of fun building my site although it went slowly and was frustrating at times. I had to adjust things like my home page and image arrangements from my original plan, but as I worked on the project my initial vision definitely warped to fit my skill set. 

I certainly got off to a slow start and my site was very bare bones on our peer review day. This is not exactly what it looked like on peer review day, but prior to making a few changes and getting feedback:

There was minimal css and layout design, and only a few div classes. At that point, I was still getting used to html and css, and moving very slowly. The main suggestions for change in the peer reviews were making sure my images were able to load and organizing my project tabs.

I had a lot of trouble adding images at first but then realized I had to type out a small path rather than just the image title, and my problems were solved. Creating my nav bar was also a big challenge for me and I experimented with a few different ways of doing this before settling on what I have now.

I believe I did hit all of the baseline criteria. I have 5 navigable main pages with a bunch of individual html pages for each digital/written piece. As far as I can tell there are no dead ends and all of my links lead to somewhere. I have a css stylesheet that is sitewide and helps to maintain a consistent arrangement, color, style, sizes, and visual rhythm that guides viewersâ€™ attention. I use a lot of images that are all my own digital projects/the image of myself. The only image with alt text, for now, is the image of me though. 

For aspirational criteria, I think my images are laid out in a clear and organized pattern and there are links to pdf files. I still have a ways to go with aspirational criteria though, and I plan to continue working on my website until the end of the semester. Moving forward, I hope to make my pages responsive, include better alt text for all images, change the color scheme to make it more accessible, and possibly change the fonts. I also want to add a footer so there is space at the bottom of the page, not just text hitting the bottom. Overall, I hope to continue making my website more accessible since that is so important.
