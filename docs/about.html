        <p>When I'm not busy with academics, I spend a lot of my time on personal creative projects. 
            That might mean I'm painting a canvas, jotting down a poem, attempting to write a screenplay, 
            or running around somewhere with my camera. If I'm not in Pittsburgh, I'm probably visiting 
            home or exploring somewhere new. I love to get outdoors whether that be hiking, backpacking, 
            or laying on the beach. I'm trying to tick all the national parks off my list but still 
            have a ways to go.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, 
            double majoring in Communication Rhetoric and Media & 
            Professional Communications, and pursuing a certificate 
            in Digital Media. That's a mouthful. I love to read, write, 
            research, and design.</p>
        <p>In my time at Pitt, I've held a heavy focus on analyzing rhetoric 
            and media through an intersectional feminist lens. I'm currently 
            conducting research on the evolution and rhetoric of sexual harassment 
            policy at the University of Pittsburgh. I began conducting background research 
            on the issue in August, 2022. Then, I won the Archival Scholar Research Award 
            which allowed me to conduct archival research in the University's Archives 
            and Special Collections this past semester. I plan to continue and complete this research 
            my senior year by pursuing a senior thesis project. </p>
        <p>I also work as a creative intern at Ethic Advertising Agency. In this 
            role I spend a lot of my time designing print and digital advertisements 
            for clients, developing ideas and scripts for client audio and video 
            advertisments, and designing in-house on brand creative for the agency. 
            I absolutely love it and am always learning new and valuable things 
            about the industry. I hope to continue this work and one day work as a creative director.</p>
