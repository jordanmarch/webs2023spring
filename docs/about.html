            <p>I'm currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, 
                double majoring in Communication Rhetoric and Media & 
                Professional Communications, and pursuing a certificate 
                in Digital Media. That's a mouthful. I love to read, write, 
                research, and design.</p>

            <p>In my time at Pitt, I've held a heavy focus on analyzing rhetoric 
                and media through an intersectional feminist lens. I'm currently 
                conducting research on the evolution and rhetoric of sexual harassment 
                policy at the University of Pittsburgh. I began conducting background research 
                on the issue in August, 2022. Then, I won the Archival Scholar Research Award 
                which allowed me to conduct archival research in the University's Archives 
                and Special Collections this past semester. I plan to continue and complete this research 
                my senior year by pursuing a senior thesis project. </p>
            <p>I also work as a creative intern at Ethic Advertising Agency. In this 
                role I spend a lot of my time designing print and digital advertisements 
                for clients, developing ideas and scripts for client audio and video 
                advertisments, and designing in-house on brand creative for the agency. 
                I absolutely love it and am always learning new and valuable things 
                about the industry. I hope to continue this work and one day work as a creative director.</p>
                <p>When I'm not busy with academics, I spend a lot of my time on personal creative projects. 
                    That might mean I'm painting a canvas, jotting down a poem, attempting to write a screenplay, 
                    or running around somewhere with my camera. If I'm not in Pittsburgh, I'm probably visiting 
                    home or exploring somewhere new. I love to get outdoors whether that be hiking, backpacking, 
                    or laying on the beach. I'm trying to tick all the national parks off my list but still 
                    have a ways to go.</p>
