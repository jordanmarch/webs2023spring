        <p>When I'm not busy with academics, I spend a lot of my time on personal creative projects. 
            That might mean I'm painting a canvas, jotting down a poem, attempting to write a screenplay, 
            or running around somewhere with my camera. If I'm not in Pittsburgh, I'm probably visiting 
            home or exploring somewhere new. I love to get outdoors whether that be hiking, backpacking, 
            or laying on the beach. I'm trying to tick all the national parks off my list, but still 
            have a ways to go.</p>

        <div class="info">
        <p>I'm currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh, 
            double majoring in Communication Rhetoric and Media & 
            Professional Communications, and pursuing a certificate 
            in Digital Media. That's a mouthful. I love to read, write, 
            research, and design.</p>
        <p>In my time at Pitt, I've held a heavy focus on analyzing rhetoric 
            and media through an intersectional feminist lens. I'm currently 
            conducting research on the evolution of university sexual harassment 
            policy and how rhetoric functions to communicate cultural stances 
            on sexual harassment and gender equity in our ever-changing world.</p>
        <p>I also work as a creative intern at Ethic Advertising Agency. In this 
            role I spend a lot of my time designing print and digital advertisements 
            for clients, developing ideas and scripts for client audio and video 
            advertisments, and designing in-house on brand creative for the agency. 
            I absolutely love it and am always learning new and valuable things 
            about the industry. One day I would love to work as a creative director.</p>
