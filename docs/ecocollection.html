            <h1>ECO Collection</h1>
            <p><em>Fall 2022</em></p>
            <p>This past year I took a writing and design course. We were tasked with making a comprehensive, personal, creative work. 
                That's where I came up with the idea of "ECO", a sustainable fashion and lifestyle brand that meshed my interests and values. 
                Within this project, I created a mock-up magazine, articles, and branding guide. I am incredibly excited to share this project 
                and feel it encapsulates myself and my intentions with design and career values moving forward.</p>

            <h2>ECO Magazine</h2>
                <p>This design functions to showcase my vision for the ECO magazine and gives a taste of the brand as a whole. 
                    All editions hold themes of sustainability and covers topics like fashion, beauty, lifestyle, travel, home all
                     with the goal of educating readers, creating conscious consumers, and fueling a 
                    passion for preserving and nourishing our environment. This is not representative of an entire magazine, much of 
                    the writing is incomplete or filler text, but it aims to display a unified aesthetic and inspiration for future expansion. </p>
